function [jval,gradient] = costFunction(theta)
jval = cost(theta) #compute the cost function over all the m training examples.
gradient = zeros(2,1) 
gradient(1) = # function to calculate the partial derivative of the theta1



Things required to be done:
1. Implement file handling to take in the data from a training example into a vector.
2. Implement a cost function which calculates the value of the cost function taking in all the 
training examples.
3. Implement a function taking partial derivative wrt theta(j)
